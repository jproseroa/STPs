The purpose of the following scripts is to be able to obtain the value of the destination cache of each STP's nodes of both Orangestad and San Nicol√°s.
This alarm was also configured to indicate when the destination cache exceeds 70% of its value, in this case the alarm will reach the NOC, and the support team will take preventive measures to avoid an outage of the nodes.
The scripts are configured to run every 2 hours, in the same way this data is saved in a file called outfile_name_of_the_node.txt, with which we would proceed to make graphs in order to predict the growth behavior of this buffer.
